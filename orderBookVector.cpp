 *                QuantCup 1:   Price-Time Matching Engine
 *
 * Submitted by: voyager

 * Design Overview:
 *   In this implementation, the limit order book is represented using 
 *   a flat linear array (pricePoints), indexed by the numeric price value. 
 *   Each entry in this array corresponds to a specific price point and holds 
 *   an instance of struct pricePoint. This data structure maintains a list 
 *   of outstanding buy/sell orders at the respective price. Each outstanding 
 *   limit order is represented by an instance of struct orderBookEntry.
 *  
 *   askMin and bidMax are global variables that maintain starting points,
 *   at which the matching algorithm initiates its search.
 *   askMin holds the lowest price that contains at least one outstanding
 *   sell order. Analogously, bidMax represents the maximum price point that
 *   contains at least one outstanding buy order.
 *
 *   When a Buy order arrives, we search the book for outstanding Sell orders
 *   that cross with the incoming order. We start the search at askMin and 
 *   proceed upwards, incrementing askMin until:
 *     a) The incoming Buy order is filled.
 *     b) We reach a price point that no longer crosses with the incoming
 *        limit price (askMin > BuyOrder.price)
 *     In case b), we create a new orderBookEntry to record the 
 *     remainder of the incoming Buy order and add it to the global order 
 *     book by appending it to the list at pricePoints[BuyOrder.price].
 * 
 *  Incoming Sell orders are handled analogously, except that we start at 
 *  bidMax and proceed downwards.
 * 
 *  Although this matching algorithm runs in linear time and may, in 
 *  degenerate cases, require scanning a large number of array slots, 
 *  it appears to work reasonably well in practice, at least on the
 *  simulated data feed (score_feed.h). The vast majority of incoming 
 *  limit orders can be handled by examining no more than two distinct 
 *  price points and no order requires examining more than five price points.
 *
 *  To avoid incurring the costs of dynamic heap-based memory allocation,
 *  this implementation maintains the full set of orderBookEntry instances
 *  in a statically-allocated contiguous memory arena (arenaBookEntries).
 *  Allocating a new entry is simply a matter of bumping up the orderID 
 *  counter (curOrderID) and returning a pointer to arenaBookEntries[curOrderID].
 *
 *  To cancel an order, we simply set its size to zero. Notably, we avoid 
 *  unhooking its orderBookEntry from the list of active orders in order to 
 *  avoid incurring the costs of pointer manipulation and conditional branches.
 *  This allows us to handle order cancellation requests very efficiently; the 
 *  current implementation requires only one memory store instruction on 
 *  x86_64. During order matching, when we wal
