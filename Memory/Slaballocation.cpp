/* Slab allocation is a memory management mechanism intended for the efficient memory allocation of objects. 
Compared to earlier mechanisms, it reduces fragmentation caused by allocations and deallocations. 
The technique is used to retain allocated memory that contains a data object of a certain type for reuse upon subsequent allocations of objects of the same type. 
It is analogous to an object pool, but only applies to memory, not other resources.
